# Assets

Currently, only artist images are hosted here. Feel free to change one if it looks weird.

## Usage

First, find out what images are missing (this can be done by going to https://artistgrid.cx/, clikcing on the filters and selecting "use live CSV" then look at the network tab and take note of what images fail to load. those are the filenames of the missing images.), then, find an image of said missing artist (preferably more than 500x500 and square aspect ratio), then add it to the /png folder (regardless of file type). after, if you're on windows, you can just double-click on batch-convert.bat, and on Linux by installing libwebp and running ./batch-convert.sh
